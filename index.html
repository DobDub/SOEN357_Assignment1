        <h2>Introduction to the Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>In recent years, the aging population has seen a significant increase in lifespan, with Canadians expected to
            live up to 82.8 years. Nevertheless, an increase in years does not always equate to a higher standard of
            living. Technology offers a potential to improve elderly people's general well-being, social involvement,
            and sense of independence. Even with this potential, older people still don't use these technologies as much
            as they could, mostly because the designs don't take into account their varied requirements and
            capabilities. Developing user-friendly, adaptive, and elder-friendly solutions that may effectively engage
            this group while considering their different technological experiences and physical or cognitive limitations
            is a challenge that must be addressed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p>Addressing the unique needs and challenges faced by the elderly, especially in times of increased social
            distancing and isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our team proposes the development of a simplified,
            highly accessible mobile application. This app is designed to support the physical and mental well-being of
            elderly users, whether they are living independently at home or in a nursing facility. By incorporating
            activities such as meditation, gentle reminders for physical movement, stretching exercises, and other
            health-promoting tasks, the app aims to foster a more active and healthy lifestyle. Recognizing the critical
            role of technology in maintaining social connections and access to health resources, our solution
            prioritizes ease of use and inclusivity, ensuring that even users with minimal technological experience can
            benefit fully.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Research and Market Analysis</h2>
        <p>Our initial market analysis reveals a landscape where existing applications either focus narrowly on specific
            aspects of well-being (such as physical fitness or mental health) or fail to address the unique usability
            needs of the elderly population. Many apps offer valuable features but lack the comprehensive approach
            needed to truly enhance the day-to-day lives of older adults. To understand our target users better and to
            tailor our app to meet their specific needs, we plan to conduct a survey exploring their daily routines,
            technology use, and health habits. This survey will help identify key functionalities that could
            significantly improve their quality of life, such as easy-to-navigate interfaces, large text options, voice
            commands, and reminders for medication, hydration, or activity. Through this research, we aim to pinpoint
            gaps in the current market offerings and design an app that not only appeals to the elderly demographic but
            also effectively supports their physical and mental well-being during and beyond the pandemic era.</p>

        <h2>Alternatives</h2>
        <p>There were many alternatives on the market but many either lack features or focus on one feature and do it
            well but there were not many that include all the features with proper attention to the individual’s
            difficulties.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first example, Pill Reminder - All in One, is an app that reminds the user to take their medication
                but lacks in many other features:<br>

                    One</a>
            </li>
            <li>The next example, Pocket Physio, is an app that focuses on physical well-being. It provides a wide range
                of physical activities and features but lacks some of the non-physical aspects of our app:<br>

        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>Based on the results of our survey, we created three personas which we considered to be representative of
            certain archetypes within the general demographic.</p>
        <h3>Persona 1: Jacques</h3>
        <img src="jacBio.png"> <br>
        <p>Jacques resides in a nursing home in Montreal. He used to be an avid painter and enjoyed going for walks in
            the park, but his mobility has decreased in recent years due to arthritis. Jacques has limited vision and
            hearing impairments, which make it difficult for him to engage with traditional communication methods like
            phone calls and video chats. He enjoys listening to classical music and reminiscing about his travels with
            his late wife. Jacques is feeling increasingly isolated and longs for opportunities to connect with his
            family and friends, as well as engage in activities that stimulate his mind and body.</p>

        <h3>Persona 2: Margaret</h3>
        <img src="margBio.png"> <br>
        <p>Margaret is a retired teacher who lives alone in her own home in Quebec City. She has been relatively healthy
            but finds it challenging to stay active and connected since the onset of the pandemic. Margaret enjoys
            reading, gardening, and spending time with her grandchildren, but she misses social interactions with her
            friends from her weekly book club and gardening club meetings. She has a smartphone but is not very
            tech-savvy and often struggles to navigate new apps and features. Margaret is concerned about maintaining
            her physical health and emotional well-being during this period of isolation.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>User goals</h2>
        <p>Find a platform to stay connected with family and friends and to stay physically and mentally active by
            providing features for personalized exercise routines, brain games, and hobby suggestions tailored to their
            interests and abilities.</p>
        <p>Access Resources: Offer access to relevant resources such as healthcare information, mental health support,
            and local community services to address the diverse needs of users.</p>
        <p>Promote emotional well-being by offering features for mindfulness exercises, guided relaxation techniques,
            and mood tracking tools to help users manage stress and maintain a positive outlook.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>User Journey</h2>
        <p>We listed all the requirements and features as a user journey map to show the general use flow of our app.

    <section>
        <h2>Sketches</h2>
        <p>We were able to sketch the app's first design after finishing the user journey. These sketches, which came
            from a brainstorming session, were essential for seeing the app's layout.</p>
        <img src="sketch.png">
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <img src="typo.png">
        <p>A single font was chosen for all of the app’s modules and features in order to increase cohesion. The font
            used is Poppins.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <img src="colors.png">
        <p>The color palette presented in the image showcases a harmonious blend of cool and warm tones, carefully
            selected to create an eye-soothing and relaxing atmosphere, ideal for the intended elderly user base of the
            app. The light blue tones are reminiscent of clear skies, promoting a sense of tranquility and calmness. The
            muted purple adds a touch of warmth and softness, while the deep black provides a strong contrast for
            readability. The vibrant orange offers an energizing splash, albeit used sparingly to maintain the overall
            soothing theme. Neutral tones of gray and beige serve as balancing elements, grounding the palette and
            ensuring that the design remains light and accessible. The inclusion of pure white completes the palette,
            ensuring a clean and uncluttered aesthetic that enhances usability and contributes to the overall gentle and
            inviting interface of the app.</p>

    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Final design and prototype</h2>
        <h3>Onboarding</h3>
        <p>The user is first being prompted to login or create an account then suggested to start taking care of
            themselve either mentally or physically. The onboarding process was designed to be short and easy and mostly
            elderly friendly to not complicate things.</p>
        <img src="onboarding.png">

        <h3>Mental Health</h3>
        <p>The mental health section of the app provides users with mood tracking capabilities, allowing them to record
            and monitor their emotional well-being through a simple interface. It also offers a platform for social
            interaction, enabling users to engage with others via chat or video, thus fostering a supportive community
            environment. Additionally, the app includes a feature to listen to calming music, to aid in relaxation and
            stress reduction. These features collectively support the mental health of users by providing tools for
            self-awareness, social connection, and relaxation.</p>
        <img src="mentalhea.png">
        <h3>Physical Health</h3>
        <img src="physicalhea.png">
        <p>The physical health section of the app is a comprehensive suite designed to support users in monitoring and
            enhancing their fitness. It includes a personalized fitness dashboard that tracks key health metrics like
            hydration levels, and sleep patterns, encouraging users to meet daily targets for water intake and calorie
            burn. There's also an activity tracker visualizing progress throughout the week and a workout tracker that
            schedules exercises, suggesting routines like full-body or lower body workouts, tailored to the user's
            preferences. The section appears to be rounded off with a user profile, displaying personal statistics and
            achievements, fostering a sense of accomplishment and motivation. These integrated features provide a
            holistic approach to physical wellness, promoting an active lifestyle tailored to the user's individual
            health goals.</p>
        <img src="fbw.png">

        <p>
            Here is an example of a full body workout with clear written instructions or a visual representation on the
            steps to take depending on the user’s preference.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, our design team has undertaken a comprehensive approach to address the pressing need for a
            mobile application that supports the physical and mental wellbeing of the elderly. Through diligent
            research, market analysis, surveys, and persona development, we gained valuable insights into the specific
            needs, preferences, and limitations of our target demographic.<br>
            In the future, we envision further refinement
            of the app based on user feedback and usability testing, as well as potential partnerships with healthcare
            providers and community organizations to enhance its reach and impact. Ultimately, our goal is to make a
            meaningful contribution to the wellbeing of elderly individuals in Quebec, helping them live happier,
            healthier lives through the power of our app.</p>
